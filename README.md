# Forecasting System - Project Demand of Products at a Retail Outlet Based on Historical Data
The problem is to develop a forecasting model to predict the demand for items in a retail store based on historical sales data. Kaggle Store Item Demand Dataset provides historical daily sales data for 50 different items sold at 10 different stores. In this project the sales of only a single store is considered. The forecasting model should take into account the seasonality, trends and other factors which effect the sales.
