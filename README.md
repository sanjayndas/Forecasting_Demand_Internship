# Forecasting System - Project Demand of Products at a Retail Outlet Based on Historical Data
This project aims to develop a forecasting model to predict the demand for items in a retail store based on historical sales data. The Kaggle Store Item Demand Dataset provides historical daily sales data for 50 different items sold at 10 different stores. In this project, we focus on the sales of a single store and develop a forecasting model that takes into account seasonality, trends, and other factors that may impact sales.
The Project flow is as described below:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Selection
Following models are considered:
* Holt-Winters
* ARMA
* ARIMA
* SARIMA
* Prophet
5. Model Building and Evaluation
6. Results
